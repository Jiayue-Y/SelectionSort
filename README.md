# SelectionSort


I made a function for selection sort that sorts integers in an array. The function also prints the original and sorted array.

For the first testing case, 10 random numbers will be generated and sorted. In the second case, the array is already sorted, so modification was made. In the third one, a descending array was sorted into an ascending one. The fourth tested an array with all same numbers, while the fifth and sixth ones tested the edge cases. 

The time complexity of this sorting is O(n^2), with the space complexity of O(1).

Below is a sample out put with a set of test cases:

Original Array: 26 39 49 16 5 37 18 40 36 30
Sorted Array: 5 16 18 26 30 36 37 39 40 49

Original Array: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Sorted Array: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Original Array: 5 4 3 2 1
Sorted Array: 1 2 3 4 5

Original Array: 5 5 5 5 5
Sorted Array: 5 5 5 5 5

Original Array: 5
Sorted Array: 5

Original Array:
Sorted Array:
